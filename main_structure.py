# This serves as the main pseudocode structure for segscii

# Things I need to support
#   1. Different ASCII schemes / ramps
#   2. Manipulation done to images _before_ ASCII conversion (contrast, brightness, etc)
#   3. Color vs. B/W ASCII
#   4. Ideally support for sub-pixel ASCII art as an extension
#   2. Ideally a GUI for all this with a test image from the source video



# First, intake a video file

# Do we split it up
